# **Introduction To Brain-rot**

This is a breif introduction to starting to code using brainrot. this will give you a basic idea of the language and how it functions.

## Language's working method.
Most of the languages out there are either compiled or interpreted languages but brain rot on the other hand uses the **ICCI** method.

Brain-rot has a compiler but it interprits the code and reads it. then it converts the file from the languages syntax structure(Infroid format) to the python syntaxes line by line. then the lines are written into a python file and then uns the python file. the python interpriter then interprits the code and runs it in the python virtual mashine.

## File Extentions.
Brainrot uses 2 defined file extentions. they are `.rot` and `.bpy `. the files with `.rot` extentions contains the your code that should be sent to the compiler while `.bpy` is just a normal python file which is generated after the compiler read the code. you can use python to run that file. A little something for a fact is that `.bpy ` stands for `brain dead python` .
