# **4. Mathematical Operations.**
Mathematical operations are a common feature amoung most languages as they are an essential for various calculations. Since the GEN-Z cant do simple math it would be even more useful. But GEN-Z dont know mathematical symbols so we used words for it.

## **4.1 Mathematical Operators.**
As mentioned above we use words for mathematical symbols. The full guide is given below

| Operator | Norm | Brain-rot Operator |
|:----:|:----:|:---|
|+|+|pluS|
|-|-|minuS|
|÷|/|dividE|   
|×|*|multiplY|

## **4.2 Usage Examples.**
Here are some examples of using them in different instances.

- Math in a variable :
  
  ```brainrot
  make x be 7 pluS 7
  freespeech||x
  ```
- Math directly in `freespeech` :
  
  ```brainrot
  freespeech||18 minuS 4
  ```
