# **Quicksart Guide.**
This contains instructions on how to start a new project breifly and how to get it running fast as possible by **assuming that you have followed our [setup instructions](./setup_guide.md) and installed python**

## Making a New Project.
Make a new folder and make a text file and change the extention to `.rot` and open that file in any text editor or IDE. The prefered Code editor for Brin-rot is [VSCode](https://vscode.com) as we have made a VSCdoe extention to make coding in Brain-rot easier.

You can put any of your own code here but just for this we are going to do a simple test print. So copy the following line into your code and save the file.

```brainrot
freespeech||"Skibidi Ohio Rizzler!"
```

_"It's 2024 yo; if you are still using 'Hello world!', No cap you are clearly a boomer. Use 'Skibidi Ohio Rizzler!' instead."_

## Running Your Code.
To run your code you must compile the code first. To do that run the following command.

```terminal
brainrot <filename> output y
```

What this command will do is it will compile your file and creates a compiled file named output and the "y" at the end will autorun the compiled file. (For more details look at the [compiler argument guide](./compiler_and_cli.md#compiler-argument-guide).)

Running the previous command would give you a output like below. But if you ran into any error feel free to contact us through filing a github issue or simply by e-mailing our contributors **(Quick reply not guarenteed on e-mails.)**

```terminal
Skibidi Ohio Rizzler!
```
After your code ran you will notice a file ending ith `.bpy` has appeared in your folder. This is a compiled brainrot code and it is written in python. Since it is a python file you can run it again using python without compiling the script again. To do that use the following command.

```terminal
python <filename.bpy>
```

**<u>!!!!! If you are thinking of compiling this file again delete the current existing compiled file. !!!!!</u>**

<br>

## Writing your own code.
Now that you have an idea on how to get started using Brain-rot you might want to write your own code. Read the documentaton further and learn how to code in Brain-rot and once your code is ready compile it and give it a go.

**<u>But remember that you have to delete the pre-compiled file every time before the code is compiled again</u>**
